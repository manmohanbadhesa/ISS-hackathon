            We're excited to present our project [ISS-hackathon]. This
            collaborative effort represents of our team, who have worked
            tirelessly to display the location of the ISS on a map with leaflet. Our primary objective with
            this project was to trying to retrieve the latitude and longitude of
            the International Space Station (ISS) using asynchronous functions
            and Axios to make HTTP requests to the Open API. We used an API from this link http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/ . 
          </p>
        
          <p class="team_para">The proplem:
            We define the lat function as an asynchronous function, but it
            doesn't return anything therefore, when you console.log(lat), it
            will just print the function definition, not the latitude. we called
            the getLongitude() outside of an asynchronous context, so it won't
            wait for the asynchronous operation to complete before moving on to
            the next line of code.
          </p>

          <p class="team_para">
            Solution: We define getLatLong as an asynchronous function that
            awaits the latitude and longitude separately before logging both. We
            call getLatLong() to execute the function and retrieve the latitude
            and longitude.
          </p>

            Results and Achievements: As a result of our efforts, we've achieved
            significant outcomes, including the map with the layout loctaion
